# LPrime Project

Welcome to the LPrime Project! This project is designed to find large prime numbers using a variety of tools and technologies, including Python for generation and AWS for computation.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and ensure you have Python and Terraform installed on your machine. You will also need an AWS account set up for deploying the infrastructure required for computation.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Terraform
- AWS CLI
- An AWS account

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `terraform` directory and run `terraform init` to initialize Terraform.
3. Apply the Terraform configuration with `terraform apply`. Make sure to review the changes before applying them.
4. Once the infrastructure is set up, you can start generating prime candidates by running `python genexp.py`.

## Usage

This project can be used to generate large prime numbers for various purposes, including cryptography and research into prime number distribution.
